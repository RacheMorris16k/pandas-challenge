District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
Include the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Math Scores by Grade
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.

spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
Use pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins.

Use the following code to then calculate mean scores per spending range.

spending_math_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Math Score"].mean()
spending_reading_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Reading Score"].mean()
spending_passing_math = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Math"].mean()
spending_passing_reading = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Reading"].mean()
overall_passing_spending = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Overall Passing"].mean()
Use the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.

Include the following metrics in the table:

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Use the following code to create three bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school size.

size_bins = [0, 1000, 2000, 5000]
labels = ["Small (<1000)", "Medium (1000-2000)", "Large (2000-5000)"]
Use pd.cut to categorize school size based on the bins.

Use the following code to then calculate mean scores per size range.

size_math_scores = school_size_df.groupby(["School Size"])["Average Math Score"].mean()
size_reading_scores = school_size_df.groupby(["School Size"])["Average Reading Score"].mean()
size_passing_math = school_size_df.groupby(["School Size"])["% Passing Math"].mean()
size_passing_reading = school_size_df.groupby(["School Size"])["% Passing Reading"].mean()
size_overall_passing = school_size_df.groupby(["School Size"])["% Overall Passing"].mean()
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.

This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
